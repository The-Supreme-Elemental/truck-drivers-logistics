The first prediction of this dataset is that the traffic model will be able to predict the number of days of traffic that will occur in the next 5 days. This prediction is based on the following assumptions:
1. The model is able, based upon the data, to estimate the average number and time of day that a given day will happen in a particular time period.
2. It is possible to use the time-series data to determine the probability of a day occurring in any given time interval. For example, if the day is a weekday, then the likelihood of that day happening in that time is 1.5%.
3. If the forecast is correct, the prediction will predict that there will not be any traffic in this time frame. Therefore, it is not possible for the user to know whether the predicted traffic will come from a specific day or from any other day. In other words, there is no way to tell whether a traffic event will have a significant impact on a user's daily life. However, this prediction can be used to help predict how long it will take for a certain user (or a group of users) to experience a new day, or to make a prediction about how many days they will experience in their lifetime.
